# 🧠 theGnaN – Pseudo-code Editor

> ⚙️ Logic-first learning, reimagined.  
> A lightweight, interactive pseudo-code editor built to help learners visualize, simulate, and improve their programming logic — one step at a time.

---

## 🚀 What is this?

The **Pseudo-code Editor** is a core component of the [`VteacH`](https://github.com/theGnaNtechHub/VteacH) platform — a logic-first e-learning solution by **theGnaN**. This tool lets students write structured pseudo-code, validate its syntax, simulate execution step-by-step, and build logic without being bound to any programming language.

### 🌟 Key Highlights
- ✅ **Real-time syntax checking**
- 🪄 **Step-by-step output simulation**
- 💡 **Logic error suggestions & learning hints**
- 📘 **Preloaded practice challenges** *(optional)*
- 🧠 Designed for **educators, students, and logic learners**

---

## 🧑‍💻 Who’s it for?

- **Students** learning the basics of programming
- **Educators** teaching algorithmic thinking
- **Bootcamps / Institutes** integrating visual-first logic development
- **Anyone** who wants to master logic before syntax

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer      | Tech        |
|------------|-------------|
| Frontend   | React.js, Tailwind CSS |
| Logic Core | Custom-built pseudo-code parser (JS/Python) |
| Backend (Pluggable) | FastAPI (for integration with `VteacH`) |

> 🔧 This repo focuses on the **pseudo-code editor frontend + core parser logic**. Backend integration is handled via the main VteacH backend repository.

## 📥 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo

```
git clone https://github.com/theGnaNtechHub/PseudoCodeEditor.git
cd pseudocode-editor
```
2. Install Dependencies
```
npm install
```
3. Start Dev Server
